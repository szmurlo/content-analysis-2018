Partnerships across our worldwide bottling system, which makes our beverages and ensures they’re in stores and restaurants and ready for purchase.  Partnerships with our valued customers—all the shops, eateries, theaters, theme parks and other outlets that sell our beverages. And partnerships with other vital stakeholders, from shareowners like you to all those we work with across the “golden triangle” of business, government and civil society.

Here are just a few examples: On a farm in Ireland, you might meet a farmer certified through a national sustainability program, raising high-quality beef for McDonald’s restaurants more efficiently and with a smaller carbon footprint. Inside McDonald’s restaurants in Canada, you might stand alongside a Guest Experience Leader who sets a new standard for hospitality, helping you order a premium burger at a kiosk. Outside of McDonald’s restaurants in parts of Florida, you might pull out your smartphone to order an Egg McMuffin (at any time of day) to be delivered right to your doorstep, the ultimate form of convenience.","A3RYI5HXC2MJLN","{}","2018-02-03 22:58:53 UTC"

That’s why we undertook the largest customer research project in our history. The results showed we can bring customers back to McDonald’s by doing what we’ve historically done better than anyone else – serving delicious meals, quickly and affordably.","A1DCGB72N1UIPT","No Social Responsibility","2018-02-03 23:02:57 UTC"
